            <h2>More About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am currently a Senior at Hanover College expecting to graduate in May of 2024 with a Bachelor of Science
                in Computer Science. I am a member of Lambda Chi Alpha and currently hold a position that requires me to be organized, 
                time efficient and effective, and very open and communicative with my Fraternity. I am also a member of the Hanover College
                Men's Lacrosse team and have been for the past four years. This has taught me to be very thoughtful of my time as well as 
                to be able to overcome whatever situation is thrown my way. 
            </p>
            <p>
                On top of the previously mentioned groups, I have communicated with the Red Cross to organize blood drives on campus, continued
                to participate in community service on campus, and assist in Lacrosse duties when we didn't have an assistant coach. This was all while 
                maintaining at least a 3.0GPA all four years of my college career.
