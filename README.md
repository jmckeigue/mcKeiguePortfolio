<h2>About<h2>
<h5>
This is my Portfolio Website, consisting of who I am, what I've done, and things pertaining to the CS world.
This website has links to my social media, my resume (still needs work) and a way to contact me
There is a working "Jump-To-Top" botton as well as a working hamburger menu on smaller screens
<h5>

<h2>The Page<h2>
<h5>
The main structural elements so far are html, css, and js. This is current and I am still waiting to refactor with React. 
I made the screen linear in terms of formatting, starting with my image and a small about me, then following the scroll, there is 
more about me, my top CS skills (from past internships/classes), and then my resume. I chose to have my socials follow;
Instagram, Linkedin, Github, in case anyone would want to click at any point they are scrolling through.
