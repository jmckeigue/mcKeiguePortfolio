# mckeiguePortfolio

This is my Portfolio Website, showcasing information about me, my work, and various aspects related to the field of Computer Science. The website includes links to my social media profiles, an in-progress resume, and a contact form. Additionally, it features a "Jump-To-Top" button and a functional hamburger menu for smaller screens.

## Structural Elements

- **/public:** Contains HTML files.
- **/server:** Contains server/backend functions.
- **/src:** Contains assets, icons, and other .jsx or .mjs files.
- **/:** Contains important files to run the program, such as server-dev.mjs, server-prod.mjs, and server.mjs.

## Key Formatting Choices

I opted for a clean and intuitive design for the Portfolio Website, ensuring a seamless flow from top to bottom. The page starts with an image of myself, followed by a concise "About Me" section, gradually expanding into a more detailed overview of my skills, resume, comments, and contact details. To enhance user experience, I incorporated a JavaScript script that enables users to effortlessly navigate back to the top of the page, particularly useful given the single-page application (SPA) nature of the site. Additionally, a user-friendly hamburger menu is strategically placed for easy access from any section, allowing users to efficiently jump between different parts of the page as needed.
